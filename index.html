            <p>
                This is a <em>draft</em> text, under development by the community. The goal is to, eventually, submit this draft charter proposal to an official W3C AC review.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any text rendered like <span class=issue>this</span> refers to content that must be finalized before the charter is sent to AC review.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any text rendered like <span class=todo>this</span> refers to content that must be updated when the final charter is published at the latest (e.g., adjusting hyperlinks).
            </p>
            <p>
                This proposed charter is available on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/lds-wg-charter">GitHub</a>. Feel free to raise <a href="https://github.com/w3c/lds-wg-charter/issues">issues</a></i>.

        <p class="mission">
            The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/lds-wg/" class=todo>Linked Data Signatures Working Group</a> is to define a standard for uniquely identifying and securing <a href='https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data'>Linked Data</a> in use cases such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model">Verifiable Credentials</a>. The work will include defining <a href="explainer.html#canonicalization"> RDF Dataset Canonicalization</a> algorithms as well as algorithms and vocabularies for encoding digital proofs, such as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature'>digital signatures</a>, and with that secure information expressed using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-concrete-rdf-syntax">concrete RDF syntaxes</a> such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/">TriG</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/">N-Quads</a>. Digital proofs apply to the RDF dataset &mdash; the underlying graphs &mdash; not the particular serialization/data file.

            <h2>Scope</h2>

                (For the usage of the terms “RDF” and “Linked Data", see the <a href="./explainer.html#ld-and-rdf">terminological note</a> in the explainer document.)                
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a variety of use cases in the area of Linked Data, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model">Verifiable Credentials</a>, the publication of biological and pharmaceutical data, or consumption of mission critical RDF vocabularies that depend on the ability to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data being consumed. (See the <a href="explainer.html#usage">use cases</a> for more examples.) In order to achieve these use cases, a standard way is needed to process the underlying graphs contained in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset">RDF Datasets</a> that is independent of the serialization itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                The scope of this Working Group is to define standards to <a href="./explainer.html#canonicalization">canonicalize</a>, <a href="./explainer.html#hash"> cryptographically hash</a>, and <a href='./explainer.html#sign'>digitally sign</a> an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset">RDF Dataset</a>. This includes the definition of a standard <a href='./explainer.html#canonicalization'>canonicalization algorithm</a>, a generic algorithm for generating and verifying a digital proof using existing cryptographic primitives, an RDF vocabulary for expressing the results of digital proof generation algorithm, and a way of representing and referencing specific existing cryptographic proof algorithms and parameters in a format that can be referred to from an RDF Dataset. The Working Group will also provide preferred ways to represent this vocabulary in various RDF serialization formats. (See the separate <a href="./explainer.html">explainer document</a> for more detailed technical backgrounds and for the terminology used in this context.)

                    <li>
                        Definition of new cryptographic signature or encryption algorithms such as RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA, and AES. This Working Group will only define usage of, and suitable terms to <em>identify</em>, such algorithms.

                    <li>
                        Authenticity and trust issues of Web (Data) content that go beyond the exchange and the integration of simple factual data expressed in RDF. (See also <a href="./explainer.html#out-of-scope">some further considerations</a> in the explainer document.)

Since RDF follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">Open World Assumption</a>, it is recognized that 'proof of integrity' cannot apply to arbitrarily large RDF Datasets in all contexts. Nevertheless, there are contexts where the integrity of the data <em>can</em> be assessed with confidence. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> are a prime example of this, where one or more assertions are made by an identified party concerning an identified subject. In contrast, asserting 'proof of integrity' over the corpus of RDF embedded in billions of Web pages would be meaningless.</p>
			    <p>The Working Group will define a framework in which meaningful proofs of integrity can be provided. The framework will use <abbr title="RDF Dataset Hash">RDH</abbr> although the hashing algorithm, and other constituents of proofs of integrity including the purpose of the proof, are identified as assertions, allowing the same framework to be used with other algorithms. Beyond the normative framework, this deliverable also provides a normative definition for Linked Data Signatures as a prominent approach used as a proof of integrity. The specification enables a 3rd party to verify the integrity of the data for the purpose in which it is offered and in the context in which the integrity is asserted.

                In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
            </p>
            <p>
                There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.
            </p>
            <p>
                To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.

            <h2>Coordination</h2>
            <p>
                For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.

                Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
            </p>

                Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

            <h2>Decision Policy</h2>
            <p>
                This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
            </p>
            <p>
                To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
            </p>
            <p>
                All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.

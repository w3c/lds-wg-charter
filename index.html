            <h2>Scope</h2>

            <p>
                There are a variety of use cases that depend on the ability to calculate a unique and deterministic hash value of RDF Datasets, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model">Verifiable Credentials</a>, the publication of biological and pharmaceutical data, or consumption of mission critical RDF vocabularies that depend on the ability to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data being consumed. See the <a href="explainer.html#usage">use cases</a> for more examples. These use cases require a standard way to process the underlying graphs contained in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset">RDF Datasets</a> that is independent of the serialization itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                The scope of this Working Group is to define standards to <a href="./explainer.html#canonicalization">canonicalize</a> and <a href="./explainer.html#hash"> cryptographically hash</a> an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset">RDF Dataset</a>. This includes the definition of a standard <a href='./explainer.html#canonicalization'>canonicalization algorithm</a>. (See the separate <a href="./explainer.html">explainer document</a> for more detailed technical backgrounds and for the terminology used in this context.)

These steps include the generation of a <a href="./explainer.html#canonical_form">canonical form</a> of the RDF Dataset using the algorithm specified in the “RDF Dataset Canonicalization” deliverable, and the application of a hash function over a serialization (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/">N-Quads</a>) that has been ordered via an algorithm specified by the WG.

                In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
            </p>
            <p>
                There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.
            </p>
            <p>
                To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.

            <h2>Coordination</h2>
            <p>
                For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:

            <p>
                To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification
                Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.

            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <p id="public">
                Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="" class=todo>RDF Dataset Canonicalization and Hash Working home page.</a> </p>
            <p>
                Most RDF Dataset Canonicalization and Hash Working teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a href="[link to Github repo]"><i class='todo'>GitHub issues</i></a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <section id="decisions">
            <h2>Decision Policy</h2>
            <p>
                This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
            </p>
            <p>
                To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
            </p>
            <p>
                All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
            </p>
            <p>
                This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

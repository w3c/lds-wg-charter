      <p class="mission">
        The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/rch">RDF Dataset Canonicalization and Hash Working Group</a> is to maintain the specifications previously published by this group. That work included a standard to uniquely and deterministically calculate a hash of RDF Datasets for use cases such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rch-explainer/#detectingChanges">Detecting changes in Datasets</a>, and was based  on an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rch-explainer/#canonicalization">RDF Dataset Canonicalization</a> algorithm.

        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          There are a variety of use cases that depend on the ability to calculate a unique and deterministic hash value of RDF Datasets, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model">Verifiable Credentials</a>, the publication of biological and pharmaceutical data, or consumption of mission critical RDF vocabularies that depend on the ability to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data being consumed. See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rch-explainer/#usage">use cases</a> for more examples. These use cases require a standard way to process the underlying graphs contained in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset">RDF Datasets</a> that is independent of the serialization itself.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The scope of this Working Group is to maintain the specifications published under the previous charter. That work included a standard to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rch-explainer/#canonicalization">canonicalize</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rch-explainer/#goals">cryptographically hash</a> an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset">RDF Dataset</a>, and was based on the definition of a standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rch-explainer/#canonicalization">canonicalization algorithm</a>. (See the separate <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rch-explainer/">explainer document</a> for more detailed technical backgrounds and for the terminology used in this context.)

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>
      In order to advance to
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites.</p>
	  <p>
      There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.
    </p>
    <p>
      To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications in Candidate Recommendation or to features that have deployed implementations should have
      <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- Horizontal review -->

    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
    TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
    </p>

	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">RDF Dataset Canonicalization and Hash Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most RDF Dataset Canonicalization and Hash Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on
          <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-canon">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

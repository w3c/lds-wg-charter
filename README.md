# Proposed Charter for an RDF Dataset Canonicalization and Hash Working Group

Any text in this repository should be considered as _a draft of a draft_. The process to get to a charter is:

1. (completed) agreement among the authors of the charter for a first public version;
2. (completed) transfer this repo to W3C so that it becomes more 'official';
3. (completed) discuss the charter with the W3C strategy team as part of an internal review;
4. (completed) release the charter to the AC as an "advance notice";
5. (in progress) gather community input and seek consensus to evolve and finalize the charter;
6. submit the charter for approval to the W3C management;
7. submit the text to an official review by the AC of W3C.

Note that, in the process, the proposed name of the WG changed (from “Linked Data Signature” to “RDF Dataset Canonicalization and Hash”). This was to align with the discussion happening in step (5) above.

The [properly rendered version](https://w3c.github.io/rch-wg-charter/) is also available.
